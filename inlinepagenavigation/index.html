<h1 id = "html">Hyper Text Markup Language</h1>
<img src="htm.png" alt="HTML Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating  web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

<h1 id = "css">Cascading Style Sheet</h1>
<img src="css.png" alt="CSS Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

<h1 id = "js">Java Script</h1>
<img src="js.jpg" alt="JavaScript Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the nine core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2024, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

<h1 id = "bootstrap">Bootstrap</h1>
<img src="bootstrap.jpeg" alt="Bootstrap Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.</p>

<h1 id = "tailwind">Tailwind css</h1>
<img src="tailwind.jpg" alt="Tailwind CSS Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without leaving your HTML. Tailwind is highly customizable and allows developers to create responsive, modern web designs efficiently.</p>

<H1>Back End Development</H1>

<h1 id = "php">PHP</h1>
<img src="php.jpeg" alt="PHP">
<p><strong>PHP</strong> (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
<p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—is returned to the web server, which then sends it to the user's web browser. PHP can be deployed on most web servers and also as a standalone shell on almost every operating system and platform free of charge.</p>

<h1 id = "java">Java</h1>
<img src="java.jpeg" alt="Java Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>
<p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired 
by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (GCJ) and GNU Classpath.</p>

<h1 id = "python">Python</h1>
<img src="python.jpeg" alt="Python IImage" width="300" height="200">
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

<H1>Frameworks</H1>
<h1 id = "reactjs">React Js</h1>
<img src="reactjs.jpeg" alt="React Js Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.</p>

<h1 id = "nodejs">Node Js</h1>
<img src="nodejs.jpeg" alt="Node Js Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.</p>

<h1 id = "expressjs">Express Js</h1>
<img src="express.png" alt="Express Js Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It is the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.</p>

<h1 id = "vuejs">Vue Js</h1>
<img src="vue.jpeg" alt="Vue Js Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It is designed to be incrementally adoptable, making it easy to integrate into existing projects or build complex applications from scratch.</p>

<h1 id = "angularjs">Angular Js</h1>
<img src="angular.jpeg" alt="Angular Image" width="300" height="200">
<p>AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.</p>
<p>AngularJS was originally developed in 2009 by Misko Hevery and Adam Abramovich at Brat Tech LLC. It is now maintained by Google and a community of individuals and corporations. AngularJS is open-source software, licensed under the MIT License.</p>
