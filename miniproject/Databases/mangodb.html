<p>MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It is designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, making it suitable for modern applications that require flexibility and scalability. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which allows for dynamic schemas and easy integration with various programming languages.</p>
<p>MongoDB was developed by MongoDB Inc. (formerly known as 10gen) and was first released in 2009. It has since gained widespread adoption in the developer community and is used by many organizations for building web applications, mobile apps, and big data solutions. MongoDB offers features such as horizontal scaling, high availability, and a rich query language, making it a popular choice for modern database management.</p>
