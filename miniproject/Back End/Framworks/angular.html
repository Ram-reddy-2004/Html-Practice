<p>AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.</p>
<p>AngularJS was originally developed in 2009 by Misko Hevery and Adam Abramovich at Brat Tech LLC. It is now maintained by Google and a community of individuals and corporations. AngularJS is open-source software, licensed under the MIT License.</p>
