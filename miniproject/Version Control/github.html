<p>GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaborative development tools for software projects. It is built around the Git version control system, which allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously while keeping track of changes and managing different versions of the code.</p>
<p>GitHub offers a range of features, including repositories for storing code, issue tracking for managing bugs and feature requests, pull requests for code reviews and collaboration, and wikis for documentation. It also provides integration with various development tools and services, making it a popular choice for open-source projects and private software development teams alike.</p>
<p>Founded in 2008, GitHub has become one of the largest code hosting platforms in the world, with millions of users and repositories. In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub, further expanding its reach and capabilities in the software development ecosystem.</p>
